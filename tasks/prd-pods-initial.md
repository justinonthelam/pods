# Product Requirements Document: Pods - Podcast Discovery Platform

## Introduction/Overview

Pods is a platform for podcast enthusiasts to track their listening history, discover new content, and share their podcast experiences with others. Similar to Goodreads for books or Letterboxd for films, Pods focuses on helping users manage their podcast consumption and find new content through community engagement.

## Goals

1. Create a user-friendly platform for tracking podcast listening history
2. Enable podcast discovery through search and community engagement
3. Build a community-driven podcast rating and review system
4. Provide a seamless way to share podcast experiences with others

## User Stories

- As a podcast listener, I want to mark episodes as "listened" so I can keep track of my listening history
- As a user, I want to save episodes to "listen later" so I can remember what I want to listen to next
- As a user, I want to rate and review podcasts/episodes so I can share my opinions with others
- As a user, I want to search for podcasts easily so I can find specific content quickly
- As a user, I want to see what's popular so I can discover new podcasts
- As a user, I want to authenticate securely so I can maintain my personal listening history

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication & User Profile

1. Users must be able to create accounts using email/password
2. Users must be able to authenticate using social login (Google, Apple)
3. Users must be able to create and edit their profile with:
   - Username
   - Profile picture
   - Bio (optional)
   - Privacy settings (public/private profile)

### Podcast Features

8. Users must be able to:

   - Rate podcasts (1-5 stars)
   - Write reviews for podcasts
   - Follow podcasts for updates

### Search & Discovery

9. The platform must provide a prominent search bar on the landing page
10. Search must support:
    - Podcast titles
    - Episode titles (always displayed with parent podcast information)
11. The platform must display:
    - Top 25 podcasts (by likes)
    - Top 25 episodes
12. Search results must:
    - Group episodes under their parent podcasts
    - Allow filtering by podcast or episode level
    - Provide clear visual hierarchy showing parent-child relationships

### Content Integration

12. The system must integrate with external podcast directories to fetch:
    - Podcast metadata
    - Episode metadata
    - Cover artwork
    - Episode descriptions

### Data Relationships

1. Podcast-Episode Hierarchy

   - Each podcast is a parent entity that can have multiple episodes (1:N relationship)
   - Each episode must belong to exactly one podcast (required parent)
   - Episodes cannot exist without a parent podcast

2. Data Integrity Requirements
   - Episode metadata must always include a reference to its parent podcast
   - Podcast RSS feeds must be regularly synchronized to maintain parent-child relationships
   - API responses must maintain referential integrity between podcasts and episodes
   - Search results must preserve the parent-child relationship in the UI

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Audio playback functionality
- Podcast hosting or content delivery
- User-created lists or collections
- Personalized recommendations
- Social following between users
- Direct messaging between users

## Design Considerations

### Landing Page

- Prominent search bar at the top
- Two main sections below search:
  - Top 25 Podcasts
  - Top 25 Episodes
- Clear call-to-action for user registration

### Podcast Details Page

- Cover artwork
- Podcast title and creator
- Description
- Overall rating
- Like button
- Rating input
- Review section
- Chronological episode list (children) with:
  - Release dates
  - Duration
  - Individual episode ratings
  - Listen status indicators
  - Clear visual grouping showing episodes as children of the podcast

### Episode Details Page

- Episode title
- Clear indication of parent podcast (prominent display)
- Quick access to parent podcast details
- Release date
- Duration
- Description
- Rating
- Like button
- Status controls (Listened/Listen Later)

## Technical Considerations

- Integration with popular podcast directories (Apple Podcasts/Spotify) for metadata
- Regular syncing of podcast/episode data with strict parent-child relationship validation
- Efficient search indexing for quick results, with podcast-episode relationship indexing
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed content
- API rate limiting for external services
- Database optimization for tracking user interactions
- Database schema must enforce referential integrity between podcasts and episodes
- Cascade operations must be handled properly for podcast-episode relationships

## Success Metrics

   - Number of episodes marked as listened
   - Number of ratings/reviews submitted

2. Content Interaction

   - Search usage metrics
   - Number of likes on podcasts/episodes
   - Average rating count per podcast
   - Number of "listen later" saves

3. Growth Metrics
   - User registration rate
   - User retention rate
   - Feature adoption rate

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement a verification system for podcast creators?
2. What is the moderation strategy for user reviews?
3. How frequently should we sync with external podcast directories?
4. Should we implement any spam prevention measures for reviews?
5. What is the data retention policy for user activity?

## Next Steps

1. Create wireframes for the three initial pages
2. Set up integration with a podcast directory API
3. Design the database schema
4. Create the authentication system
5. Implement the search functionality
